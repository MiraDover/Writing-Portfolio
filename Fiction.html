				<span class="messagebody"><p>This is the photo George shows the woman: Delia sitting on the edge of a cliff, her feet extended down the rockface, her arms in the air, dappled sunlight crawling up her green swimsuit and through the wild auburn strands of her hair. This is the only photo he shows for the simple reason that it is the best. For the simple reason that he loves it.</p>
				<p>The woman asks if she can touch it. Takes it between her pointer and thumb.</p>
				<p>“Those rocks she’s sittin’ on are sandstone.” George remembers that the woman is American, and although his English is good, his Irish accent is thick. He speaks slower. “Ye find not much else at the Cliffs.”</p>
				<p>The woman nods, but she wants to know more about Delia. George tells her that it took millions of years for the Cliffs of Moher to form, and isn’t that miraculous? Miraculous is a word Delia would have used. He doesn’t tell the woman that Delia cursed like a sailor and had blue eyes that made the ocean jealous.</p> 
				<p>He doesn’t tell the woman about that day in the photo, how that was the first time she’d taken him to the cliffs. How he’d lived in Liscannor all his life and never bothered to go. How they’d taken the ancient stone steps to the beach below, a glass bottle swinging between Delia’s fingers and the wind whipping up the path behind them. Delia’s border collie, Wilkie, followed with a wagging tail, barking at the puffins dipping into the ocean and blinking from the salt spray in his eyes.</p> 
				<p>“This is my favorite part, George,” Delia called wearing that green bathing suit and a wrap-around skirt. Already squishing her toes into the sand at the base of the cliffs. George remembers the way she turned her face toward those cliffs where, for millions of years, monstrous waves eroded rocks—solid rocks. And Delia, God have mercy on Delia, she stared down the mighty cliffs and laughed.</p> 
				<p>He was terrified of her; he was going to marry her.</p> 
				<p>She took the bottle, a sea-glass purple one with a strangled neck, and checked that the cork was on tightly. For an extra measure, she pulled a roll of duct tape out of her satchel and tore a long strip off with her teeth. She wrapped it around the cork and bottle and then called to George again.</p> 
				<p>“Wilkie doesn’t want us to send it back.” George pointed to the dog racing alongside the crashing waves. George liked Wilkie, but he always preferred the idle quietness of cats and the way they didn’t like anyone at first. The way they never said “thank you” or “I love you” but you knew they meant it.</p>
				<p>“Aye,” Delia sang. “But Wilkie knows that it doesn’t belong to us.” She pointed to the two messages curled tightly into the bottle—one from a stranger long ago and one scribbled with Delia’s address and telephone number from five minutes before they descended the cliffs. “We made it exist, George ‘n that’s miraculous.”</p>
				<p>Then, just like all the other beach bottles George would see her collect in the coming years, she threw it back to the violent waves, never to resurface.</p>
				<p>Or so George thought.</p> 
				<p>The woman in his cottage is short and frumpy. Her trousers are faded and her hair is tied up high to keep the sweat off her neck, but she has a kind face, and this is what George looks at as he takes the purple bottle from her. There are two messages inside, but the duct tape has been unwrapped and discarded and the cork is in the woman’s other hand.</p> 
				<p>George takes the bottle. The woman asks how much he loved Delia. She asks how Delia died. George explains the chemical processes behind the creation of sea glass. The woman’s family is visiting Dublin, then on to London. The kids want to ride the Eye and she can only stay with George for an hour. They have tea on the cottage verandah and then she leaves. And then George leaves.</p> 
				<p>George stands on the cliffs, watching the way the tides kick up debris that crashes into the line of distant cliffs, breaking against the layers of sediment. He counts the strata he can see. He names each one. He imagines that he is the last layer weighed down by all the rest and strangled by the rising waters. But this is not a thought he entertains for long, for the simple reason that he has a job to do. For the simple reason that he must do it.</p>
				<p>He begins the long trek to the water below, bottle in hand. He doesn’t consider the strata again. Instead, he sees Wilkie running back and forth along the waves, barking at the puffins. Instead, he sees Delia in a green swimsuit, arms outstretched toward the sun. Instead, he stops at the water, takes off his shoes, and lets the violent, monstrous waves cover his toes.</p> 
				<p>The waves are light, thin, cold, but not unpleasant. Not violent. Not monstrous.</p>
				<p>George heaves the bottle back to sea. The waves bark. The cliffs laugh. “That wasn’t so bad now, was it?” Delia sings.</p> 
				<p>He is twenty-something again. Delia is in a green bathing suit after having thrown this bottle into the sea. She is light like the ocean, and he lets that lightness carry him up the old stone steps and back home, to the only photo he shows. For the simple reason that it is the best. For the simple reason that he loves it.</p>

				<span class="springbody"><p>Mama insisted the cardinal in the pine tree out front was my dead sister. I didn’t have the heart to tell her that girl cardinals were brown—not red.</p>
				<p>But it was this that she continued to insist as we sat in the snow, digging the remaining carrots from our garden. “Thea,” she went on, rooting her fingers into the cold ground and leaning on frail bones to catch a glimpse of the bird. “Thea, look how your pretty sister pecks at that tree.”</p> 
				<p>I only glanced at the bird, praying none of the neighboring villagers were taking a stroll through the woods this afternoon. I didn’t need the baker or the merchant dragging my colorful mama off to a home.</p> 
				<p>“Keep digging, Mama,” I said, turning over snow and grappling with the root vegetable that appeared in the wet soil. “The more we save, the more I can sell.” I wiped icy dirt onto my smock and moved on to the next root.</p>
				<p>Mama agreed, placing three shriveled carrots in our basket. Several more followed, and when the work was finished for the day, we sorted out the worst ones and made them into a stew.</p>
				<p>As we cleaned up from dinner, Mama hummed a spring song from the Book of the Angels, no doubt believing it would bring the leftover carrots luck at the market tomorrow. The sound of scraping at the door ended her song before she could get to my favorite verse—a line low and quick, about foxes who waste none of their kill. </p>
				<p>Without pause, Mama wiped her hands on her apron and opened the old door, letting in a chill. She shivered but blinked into the darkness as the door creaked on rusty hinges. Mama’s face brightened. “Lovely evening, Good Lady,” she said, turning the door open wider.</p>
				<p>I moved around the table to see, peering around the dust-colored strands of Mama’s hair. A great creature of brown and gold stood in the doorway, flicking its ears but fixating on Mama. Its eyes found mine, amber, like the sun we saw less and less of these cold days. An elk. I’d seen plenty on my way to market, traversing the open ravines or calling across the shadowed greenwood, but none with such a steady eye. The elk grunted and shifted, showing off a swollen belly.</p> 
				<p>Mama gasped. “Of course, you must be cold,” she said, pulling her own jacket from a hook beside the door and placing it around the animal’s shoulders. The elk relaxed and leaned on Mama. “Come in, Good Lady, and stay awhile.”</p>
				<p>I could only stare as Mama helped the elk to the cobblestone fireplace, forgetting to bolt the door. I fixed it as she helped the elk lay on our woven rug. “Stay?” I echoed.</p> 
				<p>“We are forgiven based on what we have given.”</p> 
				<p>If she’d thought of it, I think she would have carved that phrase into the stone floor beneath us long ago. Fortunately, the Book of the Angels also says that permanence is impermanent, and to do so might have conflicted with the devout piece of kindling’s teachings.</p>
				<p>I crossed my arms. “And I suppose this pregnant elk is my dead father then?” I asked.</p>
				<p>“No, Thea. Don’t speak nonsense. Good Lady has someone else’s eyes, just as that bird had your pretty sister’s eyes.”</p>
				<p>I didn’t like the idea of anyone but my sister having my sister’s eyes, so I didn’t press her about it. Mama took a seat beside the elk, brushing her fur and speaking to the animal as if she were one of the village garden ladies. With a glance at the elk, I brought Mama a cup of tea for her cough and then retired to bed, finding sleep as Mama sang the spring song to our intruder.</p>
				<p>When I came back from the market the following day, Mama and the elk were gathering herbs from what was left of the garden. Beside Mama’s trembling fingers, the creature pulled leaves with her teeth and placed them into the basket.</p>
				<p>“Has she not stayed long enough?” I asked Mama. The elk tipped her ears but continued to pluck leaves and place them carefully.</p> 
				<p>“Good Lady may stay as long as she needs.”</p>
				<p>I pulled my shawl over my shoulders and blinked away new snowflakes that fell. There was no arguing. As long as the elk could contribute, she could stay.</p> 
				<p>For a month, she did take part—the elk helped Mama and I pull the remaining root vegetables, and she carried them in bags on her back to the market. On the path home, I offered her the vegetables that didn’t sell, and in return, she pressed her warm nose into my hands. In the evenings, she helped set and clean the table, carrying our clay plates between her teeth and holding them under the pump to rinse. Too often, I hoped one would crack and give me a reason to send her away, but the plates were handled with more care than even Mama or I had. In return, the elk slept beside our fire with her ever-growing belly.</p> 
				<p>But soon, she could no longer help, and as I took near-spoiled vegetables into town myself, the villagers whispered and pointed. Their words carried on the wind, as ugly and rotten as the goods I hauled:</p>
				<p>“Her mother let a witch’s familiar stay in their cottage.”</p> 
				<p>“No, you misunderstand, the beast is her mother.”</p> 
				<p>“Poor girl, with a heretic for a mama.”</p> 
				<p>The vegetables did not sell. I carried them home in a new snowfall, slipping on ice all the way up the path. I returned to the cottage and replaced my cold, wet smock with a dryer one. The vegetables were frozen, but I cooked them silently, cursing the little red cardinal that landed on the windowsill beside the cooking fire. It pecked a tune on the warped glass, and Mama took a seat beside me on the stone floor, leaning her head on my calf and singing the spring song in a creaky voice as she twisted a set of cheap wooden beads around her neck. Her voice should have sent the cardinals and any other birds nearby into hiding, but like me, they didn’t mind it.</p> 
				<p>When I finished the chore, I sank beside her and laid my head on her lap. She was warm, and my only thought was that there was no other place like this. Not in Mama’s Book of the Angels. Not in the world.</p>
				<p>I woke the next day to a blanketed, angry sky. Mama and I spent the morning boarding up the windows and the evening huddled beside the fire with the elk, bundled in blankets and listening to the whispers of snow meeting the earth. Through the cracks in the wooden window boards, the snow reflected the light, still falling in tufts. Silence surrounded our cottage. The Book said snow was the feathers of angels gifting the world a night of beauty. I said I could have gone to market today.</p> 
				<p>“Feeding three is hard enough,” I said as Mama leaned her head on my shoulder. The elk was asleep and we had our feet tucked under her warm belly. Between the cracks, the snow looked violet. “What will happen when we must feed four?”</p>
				<p>“We will get on.” Mama took my hand, entwining her cold fingers with mine.</p>
				<p>“How can you say that?” Tears pricked my eyes, but I wouldn’t let them fall. What a waste of water. “The animal must go.”</p> 
				<p>“Thea.” She looked me in the eye. “We are forgiven based on what we have given. Even when we have little.”</p>
				<p>Mama read me and my sister the Book when I was eleven and Papa was still alive. Her voice was creaky—old, even then—and she sat with each of us tucked under one arm. Papa leaned on the windowsill, raising a skeptical eyebrow when she wasn’t looking, but closing his eyes to listen as she spoke all the same. I’d never heard even when we have little until now.</p>
				<p>The next several nights as the blizzard raged on, my dreams were warped and distant, and I woke several times to see the fire flickering, elks and cardinals dancing in the shadows. My pretty sister’s eyes winked at me.</p>
				<p>On the final night, I pulled off my blankets and stood. As Mama and the elk slept, I crept to the windows we’d unboarded that morning and stared at the layers of snow shining like glass under the moon. Mama might have prayed. I doused the fire and climbed back under the blankets. If the elk did not freeze before morning perhaps she would at least consider leaving for good.</p> 
				<p>Mama woke me with cold fingers on my cheek. She blinked in the early light and coughed. My eyes found the window, looking out to where a little red bird sat in the snow. Beside the window and the unlit fireplace, the elk’s belly heaved under layers of wool blankets.</p>
				<p>I gasped, spinning out of my bed. “Did the elk sleep with your blankets all night?”</p>
				<p>Mama gave a weak smile. “The fire keeps me warm enough.” Her fingers shook. “But tonight it went out.”</p>
				<p>I took her hands, trying to warm them, but she pulled away and went to the pot of leftover soup, heating it over the fire. She offered a bowl to the elk who only gave a concerned grunt. Mama set the bowl down and took an unsteady step. Her thin smock looked too big, her eyes and cheeks too sunken. I ran to her, but I was not strong enough to keep her upright myself. Good Lady turned out from her blankets, trotting to us on wobbly legs. Into bed Mama went, and I covered her with my own blankets as she shook.</p>
				<p>It was two days later, with the Book at her side and my hand in her hands, that she died.</p>
				<p>I did not go to market. I cooked what we had, and when my eyes turned fuzzy and my fingers slipped on the vegetable knife, Good Lady pressed her nose to the cut and grunted something soft. Something like a song.</p> 
				<p>I sunk to the floor and Good Lady put her head in my lap, not minding when I sobbed fat tears into her fur or choked out too many pleas to count. The cottage looked smaller. The snow outside melted, water wasted. My stomach raged and swirled like blizzard winds.</p>
				<p>Days later, Good Lady gave birth. I kept the fire going and brought as many towels and blankets as I could find. When all was done, Good Lady lifted the calf onto my lap and licked a tear from my eye. The cardinal at the window pecked a tune for the newborn.</p> 
				<p>I took her into my arms, looked into my pretty mama’s eyes, and hummed a spring song.</p>
